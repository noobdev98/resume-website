    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a fresh graduate in Informatics Engineering with passionate about web
      development and committed to mastering the art of frontend development, I
      am looking for an entry-level opportunity to kickstart my career, where I
      can contribute, learn from experienced, and grow. While I may not have
      professional experience in the field, I have invested significant time and
      effort into expanding my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through
      online course/tutorials, coding challenges, and personal projects, I have
      developed a solid foundation in these technologies. Currently, my focus is
      on deepening my understanding of JavaScript, as I believe it is the
      backbone of modern web development. I am eager to explore libraries like
      React to build dynamic and interactive website that leave a lasting
      impression on users, with a keen eye for detail, I strive to create
      visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
